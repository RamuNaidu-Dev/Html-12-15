    <summary><strong>Panner Tikka</strong></summary>
        <p>
            Paneer Tikka is a popular and tasty tandoori snack made with paneer cooked in a creamy yoghurt marinade rich in spices and flavours.<br>
            Then, it is skewered and cooked in the oven (or on the stovetop) to give it that irresistible smoky taste.<br>
            It is a meatless substitute for chicken tikka and other meat-based meals.<br>
            Finally, it is seasoned with lemon juice and chaat masala and served hot.<br>
            Salad or mint chutney is occasionally served alongside it.<br><br>

    <summary><strong>Chilli Paneer</strong></summary>
        <p>
            Chilli Paneer, a vegetarian variant of Chilli Chicken, is one of the most popular dishes in Indian Chinese cuisine. Firstly, the paneer cubes are floured or battered before being deep-fried.<br>
            After that, the fried paneer cubes are mixed in a sweet, tangy, spicy sauce. Chilli paneer in its dry form is given as an appetizer or snack.<br>
            On the other hand, the gravy version is served with steamed rice or noodles.<br><br>

    <summary><strong>Pulao</strong></summary>
        <p>
            Vegetable Pulao, also known as Pilaf or Pulav, is an Indian vegetarian rice meal. It is a spicy rice meal made by combining rice, veggies and spices in a pot.<br>
            This dish involves sautéing a mix of spices, vegetables, and rice in a blend of oil and ghee. The entire mixture is then cooked in a pressure cooker, much like how regular rice is prepared.<br>
            The addition of bay leaf, cinnamon and cloves in this simple mixed veggie pulao dish gives it an excellent and nuanced fragrant sensation that just makes juices flow in the mouth.<br><br>
